## Usage

This application was interesting to build. We had starter code and had to build the backend. It was hard to make sure the terms for the backend and the frontend matched so that the application worked. It took a lot of tinkering and a lot of small and big changes to get everything to work the way it needed to work. Sometimes I would have to change the way something was organized and other times I had to change the name I gave something in order to properly follow the pathways and get the full cooperation of the application. Just when I thought I had the application working I would be missing a capital on a word...jeepers that was time consuming. I was happy when it finally worked and then my repo gave me issues. I had duplicated the file on my computer several times so I would not loose work or would have a clean file the application did not want to update or pull so I created a new repo to put the final work. I am just glad it works.
